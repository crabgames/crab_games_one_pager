ðŸ¦€ Crab Game â€” Survive or Get Wrecked

   Why it exists
   Most tokens reward insiders. Crab Game rewards survival.
   Rules are code, not Discord mods. No favorites. No safe spots.

ðŸŽ® How it works (simple loop)

   Buy CRBH â†’ hit the min holding.

   Join season â†’ auto-registers you.

   Play each round â†’ press Play (tiny fee).

   Miss rounds â†’ get strikes.

   3 strikes = eliminated.

   Eliminated balances â†’ sold â†’ prize pool.

   Season ends â†’ majority quits OR last wallet alive.

   Survivors â†’ split USDC pot, pro-rata.

ðŸ”’ Why itâ€™s fair

   Transfer lock: canâ€™t dodge eliminations.

   Auto-register: no hiding, no ghost wallets.

   No insiders: all rules on-chain.

   Bigger stack â‰  invincible: just slightly better odds.
